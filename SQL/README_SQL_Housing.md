# SQL Project - Nashville Housing

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing housing data from Nashville using both Python for data preprocessing and SQL for querying and analysis. The process involves several steps outlined below.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Data Acquisition
The first step involves obtaining the dataset containing Nashville housing information. This dataset is typically stored in a CSV file format.

### 2. Data Preprocessing with Python
Python is used for initial data preprocessing tasks. These tasks include:
- Importing necessary libraries such as pandas and numpy.
- Reading the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
- Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
- Handling missing values by either removing or imputing them.
- Identifying and removing duplicate entries.

### 3. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Cleaning and transforming the data involve tasks like:
- Handling inconsistent or erroneous data entries.
- Converting data types to appropriate formats.
- Normalizing or standardizing data where necessary.
- Creating new features or columns based on existing data.

### 4. Generating SQL Scripts
Once the data is preprocessed, SQL scripts are generated to create tables and insert cleaned data into the database. These scripts are automatically generated based on the cleaned dataset.

### 5. SQL Querying and Analysis
With the data loaded into the database, SQL queries are used for various types of analysis:
- Basic data exploration to understand distributions and trends.
- Aggregating data using GROUP BY for summary statistics.
- Filtering data using WHERE clause to extract specific subsets.
- Sorting data with ORDER BY to identify patterns.
- Joining tables to combine information from different sources.
- Utilizing advanced SQL functions like CASE statements for conditional logic.
- Generating insights through visualization or further analysis.

### 6. Output and Documentation
The final outputs of the project include:
- SQL scripts for table creation, data insertion, and analysis queries.
- Documentation detailing the entire process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, SQL queries, and insights gained.
